Adjusting the Model
Initial Conditions:
Modify X0, S0, N0, etc. in the script to change the starting concentrations.
Simulation Duration:
Change t_final and dt to adjust the total simulation time or the step size.
Feeding Threshold:
Tweak feed_threshold in the simulate_with_feed(...) function to control how often feeding occurs.
Environmental Conditions:
CO2_star_array, O2_star_array: update arrays for dissolved CO2 or O2, update these arrays.
effective_arrhenius_array, fI_values: data for temperature or light intensity
