This repository contains a Python script that simulates microalgal biomass growth under dynamic conditions. It uses a multi‚Äêcomponent ODE model to capture the effects of various environmental factors (substrate, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, pH, temperature, light intensity, etc.) on cell growth, decay, and other key state variables.
