Dynamic modelling of microalgal biomass for Astaxanthin production. 
The following repo contains the dynamic model used to calculate the amount of biomass produced. This is dependent on the conditions of our system, and its growth is inhibited by 
temperature, light intensity, gas mass transfer limitations, bacterial contamination, pH and cell decay. The data sets used were taken from the Australian bureau of Meterology, 
(Bureau of Meteorology, 2017).
